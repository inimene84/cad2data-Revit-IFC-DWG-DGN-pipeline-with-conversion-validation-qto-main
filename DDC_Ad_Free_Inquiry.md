Dear DataDrivenConstruction Team,

I am writing to inquire about purchasing the Ad-Free Full edition of your DWG converter for commercial use in our construction project.

### Project Details:
- **Project Type**: Estonian Construction Project (Residential/Commercial)
- **File Volume**: 77+ DWG files requiring conversion
- **Current Issue**: Free version includes advertisements in output Excel files
- **Need**: Clean, professional output without ads for client deliverables

### Requirements:
- **DWG Ad-Free version** (primary need)
- **Batch processing** capability for 77+ files
- **Commercial use** license
- **Technical support** for implementation

### Questions:
1. What is the pricing for the DWG Ad-Free version?
2. Is there a volume discount for processing 77+ files?
3. What is the delivery method (download link, license key)?
4. Do you offer technical support during implementation?
5. Are there any restrictions on commercial use?

### Current Setup:
- Successfully tested with sample DWG files
- Using n8n workflows for automation
- Converting to Excel format for data analysis
- Need clean output for professional reporting

I would appreciate a prompt response as we need to complete this project within the next few weeks.
